### Imperative versus Declarative Syntax in Two-way Binding

In both AngularJs and EmberJs, the syntax used to accomplish two-way binding
between models and views is through **declarative syntax** in the templates.
We simply **state the what**, properties we want to be bound in the template,
and let the framework **figure out the how**, of how to make this happen.

As a developer using either framework,
we do not need to figure out the code necessary for this to work.

By contrast, the lack of two-way binding in some other SPA frameworks,
such as BackboneJs, means that the developer has to code all the sequences of
actions for each property which he/ she wishes to be bound.
This is the opposite of the declarative style enabled by AngularJs and EmberJs.
It is an imperative style.

Some developers prefer an imperative style of programming,
and other developers prefer a declarative style of programming.
It is up to you to pick which works best.
The vast majority of those developing SPAs however,
prefer to use two-way binding,
and opt out of it in exceptional cases.

### Imperative versus Declarative Syntax in Controllers

Properties on AngularJs controllers are defined imperatively.

Properties on EmberJs controllers can be defined either imperatively or declaratively.

```javascript
var FoosController = Ember.ArrayController.extend({
    //this is an imperatively defined property
    filterText: '',

    //this is a declaratively defined property
    filteredModel: function() {
        var foos = this.get('model');
        var filterText = this.get('filterText');
        return foos.filter(function(foo) {
            return foo.name.indexOf('filterText') >= 0;
        });
    }.property('model', 'filterText')
});
```

Here EmberJs makes use of `Function.prototype.property()`
to define which properties are dependent upon changes on other properties.
What EmberJs does behind the scenes is create a
[Digraph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph),
and whenever one of the watched properties changes,
traverses the graph to recompute all the other affected properties.
Pretty neat!

Noteworthy as well is that we can define computed properties as functions,
and when these are referred to elsewhere -
either in the templates or a `.get()` on the controller -
we simply refer to it by name, and not call the function.
In our example, we would use, in the templates:

```handlebars
{{#each foo in filteredModel}}
<p>{{foo.name}}</p>
{{/each}}
```

Instead of:

```javascript
{{#each foo in filteredModel()}}
<p>{{foo.name}}</p>
{{/each}}
```

&hellip; which is different from AngularJs.
This happens because we have marked that function as being a property.
This also serves as a great example of the
[uniform access principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle).

In AngularJs, the way to define a computed property is to create a function
on the scope.
If this property is referenced in a template,
it gets called in every digest cycle.

EmberJs' way of specifying computed properties is a lot more succinct than
the way it is done in AngularJs.
This is also a lot more efficient than AngularJs' approach,
as it very neatly side steps the need to recompute them in each digest cycle.
While this can also be accomplished in AngularJs using `$watch`,
it is rather nice for the SPA framework to support this out of the box.
