## Discussion

In both AngularJs and EmberJs,
the developer only touches views on the odd occasion.
This is because both frameworks have such powerful view classes built in.

Most of the view logic is encapsulated within templates,
and this is where developers will spend most of their time.
Interestingly, this is also the area where programmers and designers will
require the most collaboration.

AngularJs and EmberJs take very different approaches towards templating,
with the former using DOM-based templating,
and the latter using string-based templating;
and thus having a number of big limitations.

We have looked at both the *M* and the *V* in MVC,
and next we will take a look at controllers,
the which that bind models and views together.
