# AngularJs vs EmberJs

So you want to start building a single-page application.
Which framework should you use to help build it?

This series of articles takes a look at two of the most popular ones:
[AngularJs](http://angularjs.org/) and
[EmberJs](http://emberjs.com/)

## The back story

While developing applications using BackboneJs, I have been itching to use a newer JavaScript single-page application (SPA) framework;
if at least to find out if it was indeed worth continuing to develop with the tried-and-tested, battle proven,
but often verbose and feature lacking,
[BackboneJs](http://backbonejs.org/).

At first, I had wanted to compare all the SPAs.

However, that meant I would be spreading myself too thin.
Besides, we already have [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) for that.

What I really wanted to do was to take the two most popular SPAs after BackboneJs,
and analyse them in depth -
pitting them against each other, and taking a look at the pros and cons of each.

Given that they both fall into the same broad category,
and are designed to help developers accomplish similar end goals,
I expected them to be quite similar.

Interestingly, they were not.
It was not just the syntax that was different.
I found that they have very different philosophies on
how code should be structured,
and even how much structure there should be;
making for quite an interesting comparison.

Let us take a look!
