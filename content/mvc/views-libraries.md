### Additional Libraries

AngularJs has got a solid templating engine going for it,
and thus there is no need to use any additional libraries for rendering.

EmberJs with Handlebars, on the other hand,
has an offering that has several drawbacks,
and naturally, some have tried to write their own.

The most promising amongst them is a new library,
[HTMLbars](https://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars),
which solves many of the problems mentioned above:
It is DOM-aware, supports expressions, supports piping,
and does all this without cluttering the DOM with `<script>` tags.

Unfortunately, HTMLBars is not yet ready,
and we still have to use Handlebars for now.
