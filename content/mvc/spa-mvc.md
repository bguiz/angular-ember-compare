## The MVC pattern

### MVC in single-page application frameworks

Prior to single-page applications,
logic for web applications was coded almost entirely on the server - **thin-client, thick-server**.
However, with single-page applications,
a lot of this logic has been shifted to the client,
and the front end developer now needs to be well versed in this pattern.

Most single-page application frameworks are designed around the **MVC** pattern,
or variations of it.
These variations are usually referred to as MV\* frameworks.

Models, views, and controllers form the core parts of most single-page application frameworks,
but they optionally may include a few more -
templates, routing, and components.

## Discussion

We have taken a selective look at the parts of web development history,
which have contributed ideas toward - and eventually led to -
the rise of single-page applications, and their relationship to the MVC pattern.

In the following articles, we will take a closer look at the MVC pattern,
and what working with it is like in AngularJs and EmberJs.
